# Diver

## TODO
1. Create requests in GUI
2. Save request in database/sqlite
3. Run request in Go server
4. Stitch saved requests in flows in server
5. Should be able to create tasks

## Questions
- Can I make a request from the client itself? not really, should be from server
- should i make this into a desktop app like postman?
- should this be a running service like redis except for executing api requests?
